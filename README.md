What is This?
-------------
Touravel is the ultimate mobile application designed to be used for all kinds of traveling and go-outs. Apart from backpackers, globetrotters and the low-budget travelers who have been primarily targeted as main users, all the active and out people are the potential users for the app.Basically, the idea is to generate content out of the tour experiences of the users and enable them to share that content, which includes various data and stats such as the path followed, places visited, activities done and so on. The vision behind the mechanism is that all the data gathering process will be automatised as much as possible so that the app meets the usability goals in the highest level. Furthermore, the social platform side of the app will uniquely serve for any traveling and activity purposes. Touravel is hopefully going to be the all-in-one service that satisfies any kind of demands on the road.

Project consists of two parts: Server and Client.

Ekrem and Gokhan G. are responsible of server side.
Utku and Gokhan C. are responsible of client side.

Further updates will be available on this site. Stay tuned...
